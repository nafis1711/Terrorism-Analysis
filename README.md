# Terrorism-analysis using the concept of 'Time series Analysis':

This project is going to give the insights for the Terror attack happening in the world in details in panache manner. For this project I have used Python as my primary language and also,I have used Dash to make web application and visualization.

In this project, I have generated a World Tool tab, which contains Scatter Geo maps, which provides the locations detail of the terror incidents, 
and a Chart tool tab which contains Stacked line charts, which provides the frequency of the terror incidents. 

The World tool tab risides two more tabs inside itself.
First Tab expounds the world map in details which gives the Terror attack information of the whole world by pointing the location on the scatter geo map. User is provided with the option to select the dropdowns to narrow up the details they want in particular for the analysis and insight. 
The second Tab expounds the Map of India in details by making the dropdown region and country static to South Asia and India. While the other present dropdown are selectable for the user to get the detailed insight.
The dropdown are interrelated, as the date is related to the month and the the city,state,country,region are related to each other.

The Chart tool tab consist of two more tabs named World Chart and India Chart.
The World chart provides the detailed frequency of terror attack in the stacked line for the selected dropdown by the user.
The India chart gives out the frequency of terror attack happened in India, in the stacked line format for the selected dropdown.
The frequency graph is plotted in 2D format with X-axis as the year and Y-axis as the count.
Also there is filter provided for better insight.
